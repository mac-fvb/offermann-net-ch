## Personal website of Michael Offermann.
Originally just a weekend project for learning and understanding current HTML and CSS practices by putting my CV on a website.

It now serves as a base to test other learning project, such as basic PHP for getting the message form to work.

``/read-eml/`` added a parser to extract email addresses from Outlook .msg files to apply basic JavaScript lessons and solve a task I faced at work.
